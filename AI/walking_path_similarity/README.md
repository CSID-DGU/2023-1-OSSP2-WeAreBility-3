This is Similarity checker between user path and existing walking paths

This is a code written in Python and needs to be modified later to use the database in Java code.

The algorithm is as follows :
1. Save the gps coordinates of the center of the districts in Seoul as a csv file(GPS_of_Seoul_Cities.csv)
2. Standardize the gps coordinates using StandardScaler in scikitlearn
3. user's new walking path is in user_Path.csv and 
   existing walking paths are in walking_Path.csv
4. Standardize new walking path and existing walking paths
5. Calculate similarity vector and similarity score, using cosine_similarity
6. If  
[a] two paths have same gps coordinates(this means one of the element in similarity vectors = 1) 
and 
[b] similarity score is more than threshold(it could be modified, for now threshold = 0.975) 
then
user CAN NOT register new walking path.

*The threshold 0.975 was generated by testing some examples.
